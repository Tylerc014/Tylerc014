### Hi there, my name is Tyler Chandler,
I am interested in learning more about the C programming language and improving my coding skills. I am also interested in learning more about Git.

In addition to working on this class, I participate in the Make To Innovate program. I am also working towards a minor in Astronomy.

My favorite hobbies are stargazing and playing video games.

May this semester go well for everyone. I look forward to working on the final project.
